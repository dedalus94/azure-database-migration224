# azure-database-migration224

## Initial setup 

To start working on this project, I created an Azure (Windows 11) Virtual Machine and I then installed SQL Server 2022 and SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio). 
I then restored a Database from a .bak file using SSMS backup restoration functionality.
